                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in frontend development and a growing enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces that transform ideas into interactive experiences. Some of my key projects include a Rock Paper Scissors game, a Random Password Generator, and a voice assistant web app for senior citizens—each focused on usability and thoughtful design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I explored real-world applications of technology, I became increasingly interested in how intelligent systems can enhance functionality and user experience. I developed a Spam Detection System using natural language processing and machine learning, applying concepts like data preprocessing, model training, and classification. I also completed a virtual job simulation with Deloitte, where I gained hands-on exposure to data analysis, client communication, and tech-driven business decision-making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm refining my skills in Machine Learning with tools like scikit-learn, pandas, and TensorFlow, while continuing to strengthen my frontend expertise using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. I believe in learning by building, and I'm passionate about creating smart, intuitive, and impactful web applications that bridge design and intelligence.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <div class="section-icon">

                    </div>
                    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm driven by the challenge and creativity of turning ideas into real-world solutions through code. I find purpose in building user-friendly, responsive interfaces that make technology accessible and meaningful—whether it's simplifying everyday tasks through clean design or solving problems with logic and precision. The satisfaction of seeing something I built come to life and actually help someone is what keeps me motivated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Equally, my curiosity fuels my passion for learning. Exploring emerging technologies, especially in AI and Machine Learning, pushes me to go beyond the basics and continuously evolve. I'm excited by the potential of intelligent systems to enhance user experiences, and I'm committed to building solutions that are both innovative and impactful.

                    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        My primary goal is to become an AI Engineer, specializing in building intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and solve real-world problems. I'm currently focused on strengthening my understanding of machine learning algorithms, deep learning architectures, and practical tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. I'm particularly interested in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and model optimization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the long term, I aim to work on impactful AI-driven projects that create meaningful change—whether it's in healthcare, education, accessibility, or automation. I want to contribute to teams that are pushing the boundaries of innovation and using AI to make life smarter, more efficient, and more inclusive. My vision is to design solutions that don't just work—but learn and evolve.
